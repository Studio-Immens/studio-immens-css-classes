Create your own set of custom CSS classes, ready to use with one click, to enhance the design of your Gutenberg blocks.

== Description ==

**Studio Immens CSS Classes** is a plugin designed for developers, agencies, and freelancers who want to speed up the visual design of WordPress sites by improving their graphics with ready-made CSS classes, designed for use with:

- Gutenberg (block editor)
- Modern themes like Blocksy, GeneratePress, Astra
- Compatible page builders (e.g., Kadence, Spectra, etc.)
- Responsive layouts and visual components

### What the plugin includes:

- Easily build your own CSS classes
- Add or remove classes from blocks with one click
- Zero performance impact (very light and clean CSS file)

Perfect for those who use a modular approach to layout construction and want to **avoid writing custom rules** in the theme or block CSS every time.

== How it works ==

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Go to the CSS Classes section and create your own classes with the properties you want.
3. Go to the page editor (Gutenberg).
4. In the "CSS Classes" section of each block, you can select the plugin's custom classes.

You can easily combine classes to achieve complex results.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin from GitHub or the repository.
2. Upload the `studioimmens-css-classes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the WordPress "Plugins" section.
4. Go to the CSS Classes section and create your own classes with the properties you want.
5. Start using advanced CSS classes in your Gutenberg blocks.

== FAQ ==

= Is it compatible with all themes? =
Yes, but it's designed to integrate seamlessly with Blocksy, GeneratePress, Astra, and other themes with a modern structure and clean semantics.

= Can I add my own custom classes? =
Of course. Go to the CSS Class section and create as many classes with the properties you want.

= Will the plugin slow down my site? =
No. The CSS file is minimal, loads optimally, and doesn't include JavaScript.
