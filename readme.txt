Create your own set of custom CSS classes, ready to use with one click, to enhance the design of your Gutenberg blocks.

== Description ==

**Studio Immens CSS Classes** is a developer-focused plugin built for speed, flexibility, and real results. Designed for agencies, freelancers, and pros who want to supercharge Gutenberg-based WordPress sites, this plugin empowers you to ditch repetitive CSS and deploy custom utility classes with zero friction.

The latest version adds seamless integration with a curated set of popular CSS frameworks—Bootstrap, Materialize, UIkit, PureCSS, Semantic UI, Spectre.css, and Bulma. Here's what you can now do in one click:

• Select your preferred CSS framework right from the editor.
• Automatically access the full list of utility classes from that framework.
• Preview how classes look in real time, directly inside Gutenberg blocks.
• Apply classes instantly—no manual coding, no guesswork.

All of this while maintaining razor‑sharp performance: a tiny, clean stylesheet and no unnecessary JavaScript overhead, keeping your site lean and lightning fast.

### What the plugin includes:

- Easily build your own CSS classes
- Add or remove classes from blocks with one click
- Zero performance impact (very light and clean CSS file)

Perfect for those who use a modular approach to layout construction and want to **avoid writing custom rules** in the theme or block CSS every time.

== How it works ==

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Go to the CSS Classes section and create your own classes with the properties you want.
3. Go to the page editor (Gutenberg).
4. In the "CSS Classes" section of each block, you can select the plugin's custom classes.

You can easily combine classes to achieve complex results.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin from GitHub or the repository.
2. Upload the `studioimmens-css-classes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the WordPress "Plugins" section.
4. Go to the CSS Classes section and create your own classes with the properties you want.
5. Start using advanced CSS classes in your Gutenberg blocks.

== FAQ ==

= Is it compatible with all themes? =
Yes, but it's designed to integrate seamlessly with Blocksy, GeneratePress, Astra, and other themes with a modern structure and clean semantics.

= Can I add my own custom classes? =
Of course. Go to the CSS Class section and create as many classes with the properties you want.

= Will the plugin slow down my site? =
No. The CSS file is minimal, loads optimally, and doesn't include JavaScript.
